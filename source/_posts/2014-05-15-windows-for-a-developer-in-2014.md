A few months ago, sometime before March, I was job hunting. I was also very voraciously hunting after all things JavaScript. I had only begun my journey about 3 months before then and was increasingly getting
mesmerized by the pace at which new buzzwords would come towards me - also felt gnawing at times. I didn't fully
know what I was in for.

I started with MeteorJS, AngularJS and EmberJS which were all similar and simultaneously different, and applied aggressively for as many JS gigs or fulltime dev opportunities as I could. Sometimes, I would get worried about making it into the developer role that I thought I would be pleased by - given my most of the developer experience in lower level programming (C, C++, et cetera) before January, I wasn't sure if web was going to absorb me well. I felt like being a jack of all trades - I knew some about being DevOps, some about DBs, some about everything but
nothing as great to feel confident about landing a stable gig.

Anyhow, the tables turned around the time I was getting to be more relaxed. I enjoyed watching various tech conference videos, days on end, from time to time. I started doing less pet-project or portfolio development and more just hanging out, so to say. I ran to [@eranhammer](https://twitter.com/eranhammer), [@izs](https://twitter.com/izs) and others, but the twist came when I ran into [@shanselman](https://twitter.com/shanselman).  Not only did I find @shanselman learned and skilled at sharing dev experiences, I enjoyed him thoroughly. Through his talks, I came to learn much about azure and how Microsoft has started getting into opensource. This JS [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzyoT4DziQ4) at fluent was rather informative and entertaining.

Around the same time, my desperation had caused me luckily to apply for a fulltime JS opportunity at a Microsoft shop, named CityCorridor. Through a turn of events, I finally ended up getting that very opportunity. The folks at CityCorridor were not turned off by my lack of experience, rather they saw the potential
in me to program in general. What's more, I get to work with [@itsmearri](https://twitter.com/itsmearri), he is
not only well versed in Microsoft technologies but also a staunch supporter of opensource and minimalism. Thanks to him, our projects use the .Net microframework called [Nancy](http://nancyfx.org/).

I have had a fair sip of JS experience in the first 2 months at CityCorridor. I am getting to use more AngularJS, and recently switched the routing to use ui-router.

More recently, I moved from my Macbook Pro to PC to challenge myself, try it out. So far, the ride has been semi-smooth. Playing [calming](http://grooveshark.com/#!/s/Mirror/32RCa2?src=5) music helps. I am also benefiting
greatly from [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org). I am starting to use Vagrant for dev/staging VMs and automation still remains key.

So much for now. Thanks for reading and happy developing.
